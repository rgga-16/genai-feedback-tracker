1
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:02,033
Speaker 0: Here.

2
00:00:16,778 --> 00:00:21,844
Speaker 0: Okay, so first of all, thank you for giving your time to be consulted.

3
00:00:22,224 --> 00:00:27,110
Speaker 0: Oh, by the way, Po, can you disregard the dual setup here?

4
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:32,516
Speaker 0: I have a computer, and I have a webcam, so I have a separate profile here.

5
00:00:33,937 --> 00:00:44,182
Speaker 0: So the purpose of this session is for me to present to you a prototype that uses AI to help designers with their design.

6
00:00:44,782 --> 00:01:06,993
Speaker 0: I'll explain the prototype in detail but also not only I'll be presenting this prototype, you'll have the opportunity to try this out for yourself and for you to give back way to give feedback on the prototype in order to improve it and make it more useful, free as a designer.

7
00:01:07,453 --> 00:01:10,855
Speaker 0: So with that said, I encourage you to be honest and constructive.

8
00:01:11,215 --> 00:01:13,256
Speaker 0: You could say anything that comes into mind.

9
00:01:14,217 --> 00:01:27,284
Speaker 0: Please also feel free to ask questions about the prototype and feel free to make any suggestions that would improve it and make it more useful for you as an industrial or interior designer.

10
00:01:27,964 --> 00:01:29,985
Speaker 0: Okay, so I'll be sharing my screen book.

11
00:01:32,327 --> 00:01:34,188
Speaker 0: Okay, so can you see my screen here?

12
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:36,410
Speaker 0: Yeah, I can see it.

13
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:55,122
Speaker 0: Okay, so let's say you're in a design session and you're designing, let's say, a residential space like a bedroom or furniture for a bedroom and you're showing a 3D rendering in the center here to your other co-designers or to your client.

14
00:01:56,563 --> 00:02:03,909
Speaker 0: And one of their suggestions is to change the material or color of a part of furniture or part of the bedroom here.

15
00:02:04,769 --> 00:02:11,615
Speaker 0: So this is a prototype that allows you to change materials in a 3D rendering.

16
00:02:12,296 --> 00:02:15,838
Speaker 0: It could suggest materials and it could also provide feedback.

17
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:17,881
Speaker 0: on the materials used.

18
00:02:18,642 --> 00:02:21,845
Speaker 0: So here in the center is the current 3D rendering of the room.

19
00:02:23,728 --> 00:02:26,912
Speaker 0: Below here you could see the list of saved renderings.

20
00:02:27,492 --> 00:02:30,055
Speaker 0: So you could save this and add it to the list.

21
00:02:30,195 --> 00:02:31,637
Speaker 0: You can also load it here.

22
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:38,181
Speaker 0: On the right, you'll see here's the rendering information.

23
00:02:38,661 --> 00:02:42,963
Speaker 0: It shows all the materials used for each part of an object.

24
00:02:43,423 --> 00:02:57,089
Speaker 0: For example, let's say for a bed, it shows what each part is made of, like the bed frame or the blanket, and you could switch with the different objects in the room so you can see what materials they're currently made of.

25
00:02:58,752 --> 00:03:03,876
Speaker 0: So I'll explain to you three different functions that this prototype can do.

26
00:03:04,917 --> 00:03:09,601
Speaker 0: First, if you look at the left, so here the left, I'm showing you the generate tab.

27
00:03:10,141 --> 00:03:15,025
Speaker 0: So this system first could create image textures on the spot.

28
00:03:15,546 --> 00:03:33,084
Speaker 0: So you can type a name of material like let's say oak wood and if I press the generate button, it uses artificial intelligence to create the image of the material that you typed in here.

29
00:03:35,007 --> 00:03:36,870
Speaker 0: So it takes some time buffers.

30
00:03:43,131 --> 00:03:51,736
Speaker 0: So after that, it will show four candidates of the image of Oakwood that is a texture map.

31
00:03:52,276 --> 00:03:57,959
Speaker 0: And you could continue regenerating the material by pressing this again, and it'll keep on refreshing.

32
00:03:57,979 --> 00:04:01,961
Speaker 1: So how about this one?

33
00:04:03,428 --> 00:04:04,169
Speaker 1: What is this?

34
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,052
Speaker 1: For example, oak wood.

35
00:04:06,072 --> 00:04:08,535
Speaker 1: Do you have different contents?

36
00:04:08,595 --> 00:04:09,376
Speaker 1: Do you generate materials?

37
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:10,697
Speaker 1: Do you have images?

38
00:04:10,818 --> 00:04:10,898
Speaker 1: Yes.

39
00:04:23,923 --> 00:04:31,010
Speaker 0: So far, do you have any comments or any questions in mind regarding this?

40
00:04:31,411 --> 00:04:39,999
Speaker 1: In terms of wood, very particular wood has a greening.

41
00:04:40,019 --> 00:04:45,985
Speaker 1: A person as a designer must prefer a more accurate.

42
00:04:46,065 --> 00:04:46,125
Speaker 1: or.

43
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:49,948
Speaker 1: I'm curious about the scaling of the model.

44
00:04:49,968 --> 00:04:53,310
Speaker 1: For example, the texture of the model.

45
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:56,752
Speaker 1: The automatic scaling of the models.

46
00:04:56,953 --> 00:05:00,015
Speaker 1: For example, the back of the bed frame.

47
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:18,846
Speaker 0: As of now Hindi pusha automatic, there's a later stage but where you're the designer my setting pusha where you could adjust the scaling book.

48
00:05:19,367 --> 00:05:37,823
Speaker 0: Okay so let's say you found something that you're looking for and if you can click up to four and then when you proceed you could select which parts of the bedroom you want to apply the material onto.

49
00:05:38,603 --> 00:06:04,455
Speaker 0: So let's say for example, if you want to change the bed frame to oak or make the floor oak, you have to click on the tabs here and then when you apply the textures, It's a temporary rendering with the material applied.

50
00:06:04,515 --> 00:06:09,002
Speaker 1: There's no difference, but if you look at the head frame, since I chose also the floor.

51
00:06:15,976 --> 00:06:19,658
Speaker 0: And at the same time, you could also view the texture.

52
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:25,441
Speaker 0: But you could go back and you could... I'm just showing you if you want to apply different textures.

53
00:06:25,461 --> 00:06:28,162
Speaker 0: So let's say you want to apply these three.

54
00:06:28,582 --> 00:06:29,703
Speaker 0: You could do it again.

55
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:35,926
Speaker 0: You could do three renderings, each with those textures applied.

56
00:06:36,486 --> 00:06:41,648
Speaker 0: So you could see what each rendering looks like with the textures.

57
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:51,453
Speaker 0: So for example here, and it's applied on the parts that you selected here.

58
00:06:53,194 --> 00:06:57,796
Speaker 0: So you could also add more, you could also choose to add different parts.

59
00:06:57,816 --> 00:06:59,957
Speaker 0: So you can apply it again.

60
00:07:10,765 --> 00:07:11,326
Speaker 1: Yes, Bob, currently.

61
00:07:32,029 --> 00:07:38,698
Speaker 0: Regarding your question about scaling, after this, you can only choose one to refine.

62
00:07:38,718 --> 00:07:42,202
Speaker 0: So here in the last step, you could add a finish.

63
00:07:49,331 --> 00:07:52,213
Speaker 0: You could add a color finish to the texture.

64
00:07:52,233 --> 00:07:56,337
Speaker 0: And you could also adjust the texture map.

65
00:07:56,457 --> 00:08:07,927
Speaker 0: So here you could change the scaling and also the rotation pot and also the location based on x, y and the rotation pot here.

66
00:08:08,567 --> 00:08:12,871
Speaker 0: So for example, let's say with the floor.

67
00:08:15,868 --> 00:08:17,208
Speaker 0: What are your thoughts on the scaling?

68
00:08:17,228 --> 00:08:22,930
Speaker 0: Would it be better if we did it in green or would it be better if we did it in green?

69
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:25,831
Speaker 1: I think it would be better if we did it in a zoom screen.

70
00:08:25,891 --> 00:08:32,972
Speaker 1: I think it would be better if we did it in a small scale.

71
00:08:33,573 --> 00:08:40,916
Speaker 0: Okay, so in order to do that, my drop down here, it shows the objects with the material applied.

72
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:43,837
Speaker 0: And then you could select different parts.

73
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:46,998
Speaker 0: You can choose between bed frame or bedboard.

74
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:50,500
Speaker 0: But for now, you can choose between bed frame or bedboard.

75
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:55,202
Speaker 0: So with the scale, with this, if you want to make it smaller, you can increase the scale.

76
00:08:55,222 --> 00:08:57,183
Speaker 0: But yeah, it's still.

77
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:14,873
Speaker 0: If you want the scale to be smaller, you can decrease the scale.

78
00:09:15,214 --> 00:09:17,176
Speaker 0: So that will be fixed later.

79
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:23,162
Speaker 0: But for now, this is what you do to make the grain smaller in scale.

80
00:09:24,023 --> 00:09:28,347
Speaker 0: So you can do it by X and Y or X if you want to make it thinner or Y.

81
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:43,282
Speaker 1: So, the larger the number, if you increase the unit, for example, it's 1.0, so it's 3.0, but it's not that big.

82
00:09:46,946 --> 00:09:48,087
Speaker 1: Currently, no, no, no, no,

83
00:09:48,367 --> 00:09:54,289
Speaker 0: no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

84
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:55,730
Speaker 1: no, no, no, no, no,

85
00:09:55,750 --> 00:10:16,396
Speaker 0: no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, You could adjust the rotation.

86
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:24,662
Speaker 0: I'm not sure if you want to adjust the wall panel on my shelf here.

87
00:10:25,763 --> 00:10:28,565
Speaker 0: You could rotate it from zero until 360 degrees.

88
00:10:28,665 --> 00:10:33,569
Speaker 0: I don't know what you're talking about.

89
00:10:33,589 --> 00:10:34,150
Speaker 1: What do you think?

90
00:10:38,598 --> 00:10:45,444
Speaker 1: For example, if you scroll down, you can input the number.

91
00:10:45,724 --> 00:10:46,905
Speaker 0: You can input the number.

92
00:10:46,925 --> 00:10:52,310
Speaker 0: I just drag the value, but you can click here.

93
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:54,391
Speaker 0: So let's say if you want a specific value like 319.

94
00:10:54,391 --> 00:11:00,396
Speaker 0: Yes, you could type the number.

95
00:11:00,436 --> 00:11:03,759
Speaker 0: But right now, I think it rounds to the nearest value.

96
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:14,078
Speaker 0: And then when you apply it, What are your thoughts on the previous screen?

97
00:11:14,178 --> 00:11:20,161
Speaker 0: Is this the right size or would you prefer to make it as big as like the current rendering here?

98
00:11:24,103 --> 00:11:29,867
Speaker 1: Well, in terms of rendering, I'm okay with the previous screen.

99
00:11:37,134 --> 00:11:44,541
Speaker 1: I'm fine with the sizing, but I don't know how many designers prefer it.

100
00:11:44,801 --> 00:11:55,871
Speaker 1: So, I don't know if there is an actual edit or an actual adjustment in the current rendering screen.

101
00:11:56,972 --> 00:11:59,794
Speaker 1: So, I don't know if there is a real-time edit.

102
00:11:59,814 --> 00:12:04,457
Speaker 1: But... Okay, in terms of rotation.

103
00:12:33,453 --> 00:12:35,595
Speaker 1: I forgot the technical term.

104
00:12:35,635 --> 00:12:38,918
Speaker 1: I forgot the technical term.

105
00:12:39,318 --> 00:12:40,760
Speaker 1: I forgot the technical term.

106
00:12:54,611 --> 00:12:54,791
Speaker 0: Okay.

107
00:12:54,851 --> 00:12:55,072
Speaker 0: Okay.

108
00:13:15,347 --> 00:13:20,791
Speaker 0: Okay, actually, it's not about rotation, but I think it's also about this.

109
00:13:20,851 --> 00:13:23,032
Speaker 1: In terms of scaling, I can see...

110
00:13:36,969 --> 00:13:43,056
Speaker 0: okay okay um I think it rotated accordingly.

111
00:13:43,377 --> 00:13:59,759
Speaker 1: let's say if I make it 90 okay I don't know how to explain it, but it's horizontal?

112
00:13:59,979 --> 00:14:00,800
Speaker 0: It's horizontal.

113
00:14:03,282 --> 00:14:11,007
Speaker 0: As of now, it's applied all together to all three panels.

114
00:14:11,908 --> 00:14:17,171
Speaker 0: Would you prefer to have it that way or would it be better with all three panels?

115
00:14:17,191 --> 00:14:19,053
Speaker 0: You can select each one individually.

116
00:14:20,233 --> 00:14:29,756
Speaker 1: It depends on the texture, whether it's metal or wood, I prefer not to adjust it.

117
00:14:29,836 --> 00:14:42,020
Speaker 1: For example, paint finish, you can use it to explore the application, you can use it on the first panel or on the second panel.

118
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:43,721
Speaker 1: So I think it depends on the texture.

119
00:14:44,221 --> 00:14:50,783
Speaker 1: Okay, so do you have any questions about regarding the adjustment here or any suggestions about this part?

120
00:15:03,686 --> 00:15:09,812
Speaker 1: I think it's just that the texture is long, the locking feature is a little bit different.

121
00:15:10,353 --> 00:15:19,361
Speaker 1: I don't know what the terms are, but I don't know how to write something like that.

122
00:15:19,381 --> 00:15:21,243
Speaker 1: Yes, of course.

123
00:15:21,884 --> 00:15:27,049
Speaker 1: I'm curious how long it's been since it's been finished.

124
00:15:28,226 --> 00:15:40,598
Speaker 1: When it comes to rendering particular materials like glossy or satin, you can adjust it in the add finish category.

125
00:15:46,553 --> 00:15:49,654
Speaker 0: Would you like to proceed with the add finish function?

126
00:15:50,974 --> 00:15:57,215
Speaker 0: Actually, there are constant options.

127
00:15:57,675 --> 00:16:02,956
Speaker 0: As of now, it's glossy, but this applies to all of the materials.

128
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:15,400
Speaker 0: So regardless of which material you generate, for let's say, if you generate fabric or steel or concrete, The finish will always be constant here.

129
00:16:16,021 --> 00:16:18,382
Speaker 0: What are your thoughts on that?

130
00:16:18,462 --> 00:16:24,006
Speaker 0: Would the finish depend on the material you want to like create?

131
00:16:25,167 --> 00:16:32,472
Speaker 1: Actually, I would suggest not as flexible material finishes and choices.

132
00:16:33,172 --> 00:16:35,152
Speaker 1: I don't know if it's possible.

133
00:17:02,976 --> 00:17:08,656
Speaker 1: I applied it by adjusting the texture, by digits.

134
00:17:09,377 --> 00:17:10,577
Speaker 1: Would that be possible?

135
00:17:10,597 --> 00:17:11,557
Speaker 0: By digits?

136
00:17:11,577 --> 00:17:12,157
Speaker 0: Yes, by digits.

137
00:17:12,578 --> 00:17:14,877
Speaker 1: From one to five, from one below, it's flexible.

138
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:18,539
Speaker 1: It's an adjustment for the material.

139
00:17:32,705 --> 00:17:33,425
Speaker 0: Okay, okay.

140
00:17:34,366 --> 00:17:38,967
Speaker 0: Okay, so I'm going to use the slider.

141
00:17:38,987 --> 00:17:40,247
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

142
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:43,768
Speaker 1: So, at least I'm going to use the user.

143
00:17:43,808 --> 00:17:45,909
Speaker 1: I'm going to use the freedom user.

144
00:17:45,929 --> 00:17:47,369
Speaker 1: I'm going to adjust the machine.

145
00:17:47,389 --> 00:17:48,910
Speaker 1: I'm going to use the material.

146
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:52,591
Speaker 1: Although I understand that I'm going to use the point and click.

147
00:17:56,383 --> 00:18:08,276
Speaker 1: But if every union is a similar goal, point and click, how much better if we are ending somewhere in the middle of the glossy anymore?

148
00:18:09,085 --> 00:18:12,827
Speaker 0: Okay, okay.

149
00:18:13,387 --> 00:18:19,050
Speaker 0: Is it just limited to sateen, matte and glossy?

150
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:25,313
Speaker 0: Or the finish is depending on the material?

151
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:28,615
Speaker 0: I think it depends, but it depends on the finish.

152
00:18:35,738 --> 00:18:37,198
Speaker 1: I forgot my bark, but it's a rough texture.

153
00:18:37,238 --> 00:18:40,079
Speaker 1: My option is to use the application before.

154
00:19:00,874 --> 00:19:03,817
Speaker 1: It's like a bump in the air.

155
00:19:04,417 --> 00:19:05,718
Speaker 1: So, we have to be careful.

156
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:08,240
Speaker 1: We don't have to worry about it.

157
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:13,485
Speaker 1: But the gloss is the middle, matte and glossy.

158
00:19:14,557 --> 00:19:17,740
Speaker 1: Okay, so apart from the machine, do you have a height map?

159
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:18,800
Speaker 1: Yes, I have a depth map.

160
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:19,461
Speaker 0: Depth, okay.

161
00:19:34,781 --> 00:19:40,785
Speaker 1: So in terms of metal, there are many types of finishes in metal.

162
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:45,008
Speaker 1: For example, we have metal gloss, which is made in the middle of the gloss and matte.

163
00:19:45,448 --> 00:19:51,031
Speaker 1: And then we have aluminum steel or textured steel like brushed steel.

164
00:19:54,433 --> 00:19:59,716
Speaker 0: Okay, okay.

165
00:20:00,316 --> 00:20:05,039
Speaker 0: Is that also the same for fabric or are there more finishes you can apply as a fabric?

166
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,172
Speaker 1: The fabric has different types.

167
00:20:07,613 --> 00:20:14,723
Speaker 1: For example, it's leather, it's glossy, and it has a different texture.

168
00:20:14,743 --> 00:20:17,847
Speaker 1: It has a different fingerprint texture.

169
00:20:18,027 --> 00:20:21,111
Speaker 1: It has a different fabric than a mat.

170
00:20:23,374 --> 00:20:27,377
Speaker 1: or for example, like velvet.

171
00:20:28,418 --> 00:20:31,880
Speaker 1: Actually, it's called matzi velvet.

172
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:34,842
Speaker 1: Or for example, for velvet, it's called shiny.

173
00:20:34,862 --> 00:20:37,764
Speaker 1: For example, for velvet, it's called characteristic.

174
00:20:37,804 --> 00:20:42,767
Speaker 1: For example, for hair texture, it's an opportunity to bump different types of material.

175
00:20:50,979 --> 00:21:06,172
Speaker 0: so for velvet my panamata aspoying okay okay noted um so you currently it uses uh glossy.

176
00:21:06,192 --> 00:21:24,810
Speaker 0: so with this drop down point if you could choose like let's say if we go to floor and then you want the floor to be glossy Oh yeah, I can see it.

177
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:28,491
Speaker 0: I'm going to pour if you want it by matte.

178
00:21:29,711 --> 00:21:34,032
Speaker 0: That was you could do the same for other objects here.

179
00:21:34,933 --> 00:21:36,813
Speaker 0: But I'm using matte at that.

180
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:41,014
Speaker 0: That was you could do it for the shelves but you're going glossy and wall panels.

181
00:21:43,054 --> 00:21:44,855
Speaker 0: So you have a material finish.

182
00:21:47,410 --> 00:22:02,095
Speaker 1: In terms of the speed of rendering, if you want to render something, you can apply texturing or rendering material to the view.

183
00:22:04,396 --> 00:22:05,536
Speaker 1: based from my experience.

184
00:22:05,776 --> 00:22:10,818
Speaker 1: So, for this example, for example, a SketchUp and then Lumion for rendering.

185
00:22:10,878 --> 00:22:36,605
Speaker 1: For SketchUp, for example, But the rendering is still good, but it's not as good as the other elements.

186
00:22:36,625 --> 00:22:41,147
Speaker 1: So I think that's a good thing for this app.

187
00:22:41,227 --> 00:22:48,591
Speaker 1: It has the ability to do the rendering process, but also the texture of the model.

188
00:22:49,311 --> 00:22:49,531
Speaker 0: Okay.

189
00:22:51,292 --> 00:22:54,897
Speaker 0: Currently, I haven't tried using it yet.

190
00:23:02,574 --> 00:23:07,997
Speaker 0: Yeah, so one of the blenders that I use for rendering is Cycles.

191
00:23:08,017 --> 00:23:12,759
Speaker 0: I think that's the professional kind of render you use for, let's say, interior design.

192
00:23:12,879 --> 00:23:14,419
Speaker 0: That's the same as Lumion.

193
00:23:26,525 --> 00:23:30,127
Speaker 0: But this renderer, it uses a renderer called Eevee.

194
00:23:30,147 --> 00:23:33,468
Speaker 0: It's not as accurate as what you see in Lumion.

195
00:23:33,548 --> 00:23:36,449
Speaker 0: It's not as accurate as what you see in Lumion.

196
00:23:36,469 --> 00:23:40,771
Speaker 0: It's not as accurate as what you see in Lumion.

197
00:23:42,452 --> 00:23:49,236
Speaker 0: But going back to your question of what happens if we are not able to see objects.

198
00:23:51,537 --> 00:23:55,480
Speaker 0: About that, what objects were you expecting more in the bedroom?

199
00:23:58,848 --> 00:24:53,523
Speaker 1: For example, you're going to add appliances like a phone, alarm clock, additional lighting, additional lighting fixture, bedside lamp, bedside lamp, a shelving, a libro, accent boxes, So, up to those small details, for example, for example, for example, for example, for example, for example, for example, for example, for example, for example, for example, So if you look at yourself, you can see that you can see that you can see that you can see that you can see that you can see that you can see that

200
00:24:54,904 --> 00:24:56,705
Speaker 0: you can see that you can

201
00:24:56,785 --> 00:25:03,649
Speaker 1: see that you can see that you can see that you can see that you can

202
00:25:04,209 --> 00:25:04,950
Speaker 0: see that you

203
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:18,983
Speaker 1: can see that you can see that you can see that you can see that a 3D model and then factor it in, but we get to rendering.

204
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:20,900
Speaker 0: Okay.

205
00:25:22,461 --> 00:25:23,362
Speaker 0: Okay, I understood.

206
00:25:23,903 --> 00:25:24,123
Speaker 0: Okay.

207
00:25:27,285 --> 00:25:31,448
Speaker 0: Do you have any comments regarding the finish?

208
00:25:31,589 --> 00:25:37,913
Speaker 0: I mean, actually in this room, were you expecting more furniture to be added?

209
00:25:37,973 --> 00:25:47,361
Speaker 0: Because it only uses cabinets or drawers here, the shelves and a bed.

210
00:25:48,081 --> 00:26:20,435
Speaker 1: I think if you have additional element lamps, if you have accessories, for example, if you have a dual-ability rendering, when it comes to accessories, for example, ceiling lamps or bedside lamps, would adding more furniture like let's say like a study table or let's say a chair.

211
00:26:20,716 --> 00:26:22,360
Speaker 0: would that also be helpful?

212
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:29,922
Speaker 1: I think that for me, it's more of an accesory sound.

213
00:26:30,222 --> 00:26:31,383
Speaker 0: Okay, noted.

214
00:26:32,303 --> 00:26:36,625
Speaker 0: Okay, so shall we move on to the module you might add in color?

215
00:26:36,645 --> 00:26:38,366
Speaker 0: Okay, sure.

216
00:26:38,606 --> 00:26:50,590
Speaker 0: So here, currently if you press this, but if you select this color picker, So you could create your own color here.

217
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:53,951
Speaker 0: So you could actually apply it onto the part of the object.

218
00:26:53,971 --> 00:26:55,811
Speaker 0: So let's say with the floor, you apply this.

219
00:26:55,831 --> 00:26:56,311
Speaker 0: Blending.

220
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:19,984
Speaker 1: But what about wood materials?

221
00:27:20,004 --> 00:27:21,846
Speaker 1: They are not manipulated by a scholar.

222
00:27:26,668 --> 00:27:27,789
Speaker 0: Yes.

223
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:34,275
Speaker 0: So this is just simply through using the rendering application I use.

224
00:27:34,636 --> 00:27:36,437
Speaker 0: So you can pick different materials.

225
00:27:36,978 --> 00:27:42,163
Speaker 0: But let's say you have a color palette.

226
00:27:42,523 --> 00:27:50,272
Speaker 0: You could actually go to this option called suggest colors and then With this, this uses AI.

227
00:27:50,292 --> 00:27:51,413
Speaker 0: Do you know ChatGPT?

228
00:27:57,009 --> 00:28:09,793
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, automatically you can use SE for a specific topic and then automatically you can generate an article or something.

229
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:12,734
Speaker 1: Yes, so this prototype takes advantage of ChatGPT.

230
00:28:18,736 --> 00:28:22,959
Speaker 0: as an API that was from here you could from this drop down.

231
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:28,483
Speaker 0: currently you could have it suggest color palettes based on interior design style.

232
00:28:29,323 --> 00:28:36,268
Speaker 0: so my drop down point oh you can and detail my choices like industrial or bohemian minimalist.

233
00:28:37,069 --> 00:28:53,181
Speaker 0: and so when you suggest the color palettes You can also refresh again.

234
00:28:53,281 --> 00:28:59,213
Speaker 1: Okay, that's an even set of color palettes you need to project.

235
00:29:00,098 --> 00:29:08,725
Speaker 0: yes it's not always consistent but it makes color palettes up to five swatches.

236
00:29:09,845 --> 00:29:15,089
Speaker 0: so after that you could let's say select more than one when you go back to the generate tab.

237
00:29:23,415 --> 00:29:25,215
Speaker 1: Okay, I was about to comment on that.

238
00:29:25,355 --> 00:29:34,318
Speaker 1: I thought that my option was that I could select a selection, but I didn't want to keep it bad or what.

239
00:29:35,199 --> 00:29:36,699
Speaker 0: The input.

240
00:29:36,719 --> 00:29:40,441
Speaker 0: So, that was my option.

241
00:29:41,261 --> 00:29:47,043
Speaker 0: I was using this to apply to the object using these swatches.

242
00:29:48,613 --> 00:29:51,876
Speaker 0: But finally, let's say you're done with it.

243
00:29:52,476 --> 00:29:57,601
Speaker 0: If you want to apply this change to the create rendering, you have to do it right.

244
00:29:57,641 --> 00:30:02,665
Speaker 0: You have to do it right in the create rendering window.

245
00:30:02,765 --> 00:30:10,191
Speaker 0: So, when you press this, when you press apply, so as of now, we have a prototype that we will use.

246
00:30:17,131 --> 00:30:27,053
Speaker 0: I think it takes around two minutes for the rendering to update.

247
00:30:27,593 --> 00:30:32,415
Speaker 0: But that's how the prototype works currently.

248
00:30:34,416 --> 00:30:45,925
Speaker 1: Yes, I think one factor that you can consider is that as of now, as a designer, I think there is a special feature that is being offered by a designer.

249
00:30:45,965 --> 00:30:50,049
Speaker 1: I think there is a special feature that is being offered by a designer.

250
00:30:50,189 --> 00:30:53,371
Speaker 1: I think there is a special feature that is being offered by a designer.

251
00:31:03,059 --> 00:31:08,981
Speaker 1: But I'm not sure if you've also tried exploring the interface.

252
00:31:09,801 --> 00:31:13,403
Speaker 1: It's a very complex interface.

253
00:31:13,583 --> 00:31:26,087
Speaker 1: So if you want to use some material like multi-textures, or manipulate machines, or bumps, you can use this in detail.

254
00:31:26,707 --> 00:31:31,188
Speaker 1: If you want to experience the experience, you have to do so.

255
00:31:31,208 --> 00:31:36,170
Speaker 1: I prefer to do so because it's a simple interface.

256
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:39,250
Speaker 1: But at the same time, it's simplified.

257
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:41,651
Speaker 1: So if I wanted it to be simplified, you have to do so.

258
00:31:41,731 --> 00:31:42,871
Speaker 1: It's a real-time application.

259
00:31:53,074 --> 00:32:12,519
Speaker 1: I don't know if it's possible to render it, but it's possible to render it, but it's possible to render it, but it's possible to render it, but it's possible to render it, but it's possible to render it, but it's possible to render it, but it's possible to render it, but it's possible to render it, but it's possible to render it, but it's possible to render it, but it's possible to render it, but it's possible to render it, but it's possible

260
00:32:13,239 --> 00:32:14,419
Speaker 0: to render it, but it's

261
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:15,660
Speaker 1: possible

262
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:19,961
Speaker 0: to render it, but it's possible to render it, but it's possible to render it, but it's possible

263
00:32:20,521 --> 00:32:21,361
Speaker 1: to render it,

264
00:32:22,779 --> 00:32:23,920
Speaker 0: How do you spell that?

265
00:32:24,861 --> 00:32:32,268
Speaker 1: Letter D as in victory, and then R, rabbit, apple, and then yellow.

266
00:32:32,508 --> 00:32:34,650
Speaker 0: Apple, yellow, V-Ray, software.

267
00:32:35,371 --> 00:32:35,651
Speaker 1: Yeah.

268
00:32:36,752 --> 00:32:38,814
Speaker 1: So, rendering software.

269
00:32:39,154 --> 00:32:45,120
Speaker 1: Usually, Gina Gambit plug-ins a SketchUp, or Pedro D'Inción incorporates 3ds max.

270
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,422
Speaker 1: I don't know if you know what that is.

271
00:32:48,693 --> 00:32:53,035
Speaker 0: Okay, so I'll look into this very pretty Lumion.

272
00:32:53,155 --> 00:32:54,396
Speaker 0: I've heard of that before.

273
00:32:54,416 --> 00:33:02,520
Speaker 1: Actually, there was an application that I purchased recently.

274
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:07,662
Speaker 1: It was simplified by Lumion.

275
00:33:07,702 --> 00:33:10,844
Speaker 1: So, simplified by Lumion, but it was simplified by Lumion.

276
00:33:11,404 --> 00:33:12,845
Speaker 1: Let me ask you something.

277
00:33:23,619 --> 00:33:24,259
Speaker 1: Enscape.

278
00:33:24,779 --> 00:33:27,320
Speaker 1: So letter E.

279
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:32,121
Speaker 0: Enscape.

280
00:33:33,101 --> 00:33:34,242
Speaker 1: Enscape.

281
00:33:34,862 --> 00:33:39,323
Speaker 0: Ah, real-time rendering in virtual reality.

282
00:33:39,343 --> 00:33:41,304
Speaker 0: I'll check it out.

283
00:33:41,624 --> 00:33:45,325
Speaker 1: Sabinella, Sabinella, one of our other designers in our friend school.

284
00:33:45,865 --> 00:33:47,206
Speaker 1: But I haven't tried using it.

285
00:33:47,286 --> 00:33:52,409
Speaker 1: I think it's because it's the original version of the original version of the application.

286
00:33:52,449 --> 00:33:54,471
Speaker 1: But I haven't tried comparing it.

287
00:34:07,687 --> 00:34:09,947
Speaker 0: Yes, I'll check out the interface.

288
00:34:09,967 --> 00:34:16,471
Speaker 0: If you look at the current rendering, you can see my bug detail.

289
00:34:16,491 --> 00:34:29,838
Speaker 0: But if you look at the bed, But it doesn't reflect any of the materials for each part.

290
00:34:30,138 --> 00:34:34,400
Speaker 0: So for the bed frame, headboard, that kind of thing.

291
00:34:34,501 --> 00:34:38,024
Speaker 0: Then the floor, the material.

292
00:34:38,043 --> 00:34:44,268
Speaker 0: I don't know if it's finished, but the color, you can see it here.

293
00:34:44,929 --> 00:34:48,952
Speaker 0: Would it help if I added some color to it?

294
00:34:50,284 --> 00:34:57,872
Speaker 1: I think my input will be reflected in detail, but it will be up close if it is not adjusted.

295
00:34:58,473 --> 00:35:00,454
Speaker 1: I have one more comment.

296
00:35:00,574 --> 00:35:02,296
Speaker 1: It is about rendering time.

297
00:35:09,722 --> 00:35:18,185
Speaker 1: For example, if you look at V-Ray, if you look at the render, you can see the percentage of rendering.

298
00:35:18,205 --> 00:35:28,570
Speaker 1: If you look at the percentage of 25, 50, 90, you can see that this is a lot of experience.

299
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:34,792
Speaker 1: If you look at the reflectors, you can see the percentage of the time.

300
00:35:34,832 --> 00:35:42,755
Speaker 1: So if you look at the user, you can see that For example, two minutes before the final render.

301
00:35:42,995 --> 00:35:48,617
Speaker 1: So, for me, based on my experience, I can do it in five minutes.

302
00:35:49,358 --> 00:35:52,159
Speaker 1: So, I can do other things while it's rendering.

303
00:35:52,799 --> 00:35:57,581
Speaker 1: So, I don't know if I helped in the UX or UI design.

304
00:35:57,681 --> 00:35:59,742
Speaker 0: Okay, okay.

305
00:35:59,762 --> 00:36:00,922
Speaker 0: Okay, no tip.

306
00:36:01,262 --> 00:36:09,949
Speaker 0: So, when you press apply to current rendering, So I could do other things aside from what it's really doing.

307
00:36:24,321 --> 00:36:26,104
Speaker 0: Okay, not dead.

308
00:36:27,827 --> 00:36:30,411
Speaker 0: So that's the generate module.

309
00:36:30,431 --> 00:36:46,907
Speaker 0: So before... So before we move on to suggesting, what are your like overall thoughts on the models?

310
00:36:49,227 --> 00:36:52,148
Speaker 0: What can you suggest overall, apart from what you mentioned earlier?

311
00:36:55,328 --> 00:36:59,649
Speaker 0: What are the things you're looking for to make this like better in a sense?

312
00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:04,110
Speaker 1: I think this is a good example.

313
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:07,371
Speaker 1: I think it's the best material choices.

314
00:37:08,004 --> 00:37:15,352
Speaker 1: I think it would be much better if we had more capacity to generate materials.

315
00:37:15,372 --> 00:37:32,309
Speaker 1: For example, for this open generator material, And then, for example, if you generate a lot of material, you can compare the previous selection to the previous one.

316
00:37:32,329 --> 00:37:48,324
Speaker 1: So, I think, I don't know, it would be better if it were made in the future, or if it was made in a wide range, in order to generate the material, the type of material, under the opal, that would be the interface.

317
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:49,109
Speaker 0: Okay.

318
00:37:49,609 --> 00:37:53,770
Speaker 0: So, when you generate this, that was my result.

319
00:37:54,290 --> 00:37:56,711
Speaker 0: You're hoping to generate the results.

320
00:37:56,751 --> 00:37:58,912
Speaker 0: You can go back to the previous one in January.

321
00:37:58,932 --> 00:37:59,172
Speaker 0: Yes.

322
00:37:59,192 --> 00:38:02,813
Speaker 0: So, if you want to generate the results, you can go back to the previous one.

323
00:38:02,833 --> 00:38:07,654
Speaker 1: If you want to generate the results, you can go back to the previous one.

324
00:38:12,455 --> 00:38:22,220
Speaker 1: Even when it comes to technicalities or difficulty in the application.

325
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:29,584
Speaker 1: For me, I prefer to simplify things as compared to other elements.

326
00:38:42,896 --> 00:38:46,781
Speaker 0: Okay, what are your comments about select noun parts?

327
00:38:47,221 --> 00:38:49,984
Speaker 0: Because here you have to point and click.

328
00:38:52,765 --> 00:38:56,747
Speaker 1: Actually, I don't have a feature anymore, but I can tell you about it.

329
00:38:56,767 --> 00:38:58,168
Speaker 1: I have a preview of it.

330
00:38:58,248 --> 00:39:02,370
Speaker 1: I don't have a feature anymore, but at least I can tell you about it.

331
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:09,614
Speaker 1: I can tell you about it, but I can tell you about it, but I can tell you about it, but I can tell

332
00:39:09,674 --> 00:39:09,874
Speaker 0: you

333
00:39:10,214 --> 00:39:18,038
Speaker 1: about it, but I can tell you about it, but I can tell you about it, but I can tell you about it, but I can tell you about it.

334
00:39:26,099 --> 00:39:31,943
Speaker 1: But when it comes to difficulty, I think for me it should be done.

335
00:39:32,223 --> 00:39:33,644
Speaker 1: I think it should be an option.

336
00:39:33,724 --> 00:39:38,107
Speaker 1: I think it should be an adjustment.

337
00:39:38,187 --> 00:39:42,070
Speaker 1: I am curious about the accessories elements in this room.

338
00:39:50,962 --> 00:39:53,844
Speaker 0: Let's say for accessories, you put books.

339
00:39:55,205 --> 00:39:58,728
Speaker 0: Would you expect books to have different options?

340
00:39:58,748 --> 00:39:58,808
Speaker 0: Yes.

341
00:39:59,048 --> 00:40:04,112
Speaker 0: I'm expecting books to have different selections.

342
00:40:04,152 --> 00:40:04,913
Speaker 1: For example, in books.

343
00:40:13,499 --> 00:40:18,941
Speaker 1: So when you're changing, let's say books, you want to like change your book cover or something like that.

344
00:40:40,991 --> 00:40:48,638
Speaker 1: I don't have a name, but I have a name.

345
00:40:48,978 --> 00:40:55,824
Speaker 1: While I'm selecting this, I'm going to use this as a model, as a highlight, so it's a bit different.

346
00:40:55,844 --> 00:40:56,804
Speaker 1: Let's see.

347
00:40:59,694 --> 00:41:03,638
Speaker 1: I'm pointing some walls.

348
00:41:03,658 --> 00:41:05,480
Speaker 1: For example, this one.

349
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,983
Speaker 1: This is for the highlights.

350
00:41:08,343 --> 00:41:10,325
Speaker 1: For the outline, it's blue.

351
00:41:10,806 --> 00:41:11,026
Speaker 0: Yes.

352
00:41:11,707 --> 00:41:12,067
Speaker 0: Okay.

353
00:41:12,327 --> 00:41:12,568
Speaker 0: Okay.

354
00:41:12,588 --> 00:41:14,470
Speaker 0: So for the walls, there is no option.

355
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:17,072
Speaker 0: For the highlights, there is no option.

356
00:41:21,511 --> 00:41:23,292
Speaker 0: okay would you prefer to?

357
00:41:23,552 --> 00:41:28,555
Speaker 0: would it be easier for you to map the objects by clicking on the picture itself?

358
00:41:30,096 --> 00:41:36,000
Speaker 1: um like yeah okay and i think that would be much better.

359
00:41:37,041 --> 00:41:44,946
Speaker 0: see about okay understood okay um so um do you have?

360
00:41:45,466 --> 00:41:48,748
Speaker 0: um any other questions or comments regarding this?

361
00:41:49,315 --> 00:41:59,719
Speaker 1: Besides the material, can you also, if possible, manipulate the environment setting?

362
00:42:00,299 --> 00:42:08,302
Speaker 1: Like for example, what if I wanted it to be outside the environment?

363
00:42:09,982 --> 00:42:10,903
Speaker 1: Would it be possible?

364
00:42:12,868 --> 00:42:17,351
Speaker 0: For example, what is the outside environment?

365
00:42:17,511 --> 00:42:21,334
Speaker 1: For example, there is a window outside the window.

366
00:42:33,422 --> 00:42:37,164
Speaker 1: But it's possible that they will be able to customize the skylines for houses and subdivisions, right?

367
00:42:37,184 --> 00:42:38,344
Speaker 1: Maybe in your background.

368
00:42:50,566 --> 00:42:54,870
Speaker 1: I think it's very useful in a realistic rendering setting.

369
00:42:54,890 --> 00:42:56,311
Speaker 1: I think it's a good feature.

370
00:43:15,709 --> 00:43:22,653
Speaker 1: You can explore... You can adjust the direction of the sun or sunrise, brightness of the sun, brightness of the sky.

371
00:43:22,673 --> 00:43:24,454
Speaker 1: How you can consider future developments in the app.

372
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:45,643
Speaker 0: Yes, okay.

373
00:43:45,864 --> 00:43:49,289
Speaker 0: I'll look into it just now.

374
00:43:51,714 --> 00:43:57,684
Speaker 0: So anything else before we move on to the suggestion part of the application?

375
00:43:58,414 --> 00:44:01,618
Speaker 1: I think I'm good with the portion.

376
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:04,342
Speaker 1: Okay.

377
00:44:04,422 --> 00:44:08,728
Speaker 0: After I introduce all of the functions, you could try it out yourself.

378
00:44:09,669 --> 00:44:11,711
Speaker 0: In Zoom, I enabled remote access.

379
00:44:14,525 --> 00:44:25,730
Speaker 0: So this app, it could also suggest materials or colors to you based on certain criteria.

380
00:44:26,371 --> 00:44:35,015
Speaker 0: So far, it suggests materials and colors based on the interior design style you're looking for.

381
00:44:35,695 --> 00:44:48,028
Speaker 0: So herepo, if you look at the first, you could suggest there are all types of materials or you could suggest what type of wood or metal or fabric and then you can suggest your design style herepo.

382
00:44:49,430 --> 00:44:57,539
Speaker 0: So and then they help it suggest based on this herepo.

383
00:45:01,912 --> 00:45:14,388
Speaker 1: I think it must be interesting, at least as a designer, to look at the traditional type or Scandinavian type of a certain material.

384
00:45:15,808 --> 00:45:19,252
Speaker 0: Okay.

385
00:45:20,013 --> 00:45:22,736
Speaker 0: So, there's velvet, there's cotton, there's linen.

386
00:45:22,756 --> 00:45:24,858
Speaker 0: That was with this option, to generate the material.

387
00:45:24,898 --> 00:45:28,222
Speaker 0: If you look at the previous page, to generate that certain material.

388
00:45:36,831 --> 00:45:37,552
Speaker 0: material here.

389
00:45:38,093 --> 00:45:45,061
Speaker 0: So from here I generated this, but I'm gonna put a small generation.

390
00:45:54,071 --> 00:45:58,055
Speaker 0: That was for the suggestion of colors.

391
00:45:58,135 --> 00:46:00,418
Speaker 0: I think I've shown this before, but I'll show it one more time.

392
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:06,725
Speaker 0: You could type in different styles and it could suggest color palettes again.

393
00:46:06,905 --> 00:46:11,510
Speaker 0: That was put in, and then you got the meeting when you're adding the color finish book.

394
00:46:17,997 --> 00:46:23,743
Speaker 0: So starting with the suggesting of the materials.

395
00:46:26,066 --> 00:46:28,909
Speaker 0: So again, what are your thoughts on this module?

396
00:46:28,989 --> 00:46:30,310
Speaker 0: What are the things you like?

397
00:46:30,951 --> 00:46:35,876
Speaker 0: What are the things that you find confusing or my comments to make it better?

398
00:46:38,355 --> 00:46:45,359
Speaker 1: Well, in terms of... I don't know if it's the same capability as Hawaii's rain.

399
00:46:45,659 --> 00:46:52,763
Speaker 1: But what if I'm interested to use a material that is more solid?

400
00:46:53,123 --> 00:46:59,106
Speaker 1: Or a fiber-textured material?

401
00:46:59,567 --> 00:47:00,807
Speaker 1: Or a weaved material?

402
00:47:00,827 --> 00:47:02,668
Speaker 1: It's possible.

403
00:47:04,289 --> 00:47:06,610
Speaker 0: I think so.

404
00:47:07,170 --> 00:47:11,172
Speaker 0: Like here you type in like weaved fabric.

405
00:47:11,192 --> 00:47:11,892
Speaker 0: I mean weaved.

406
00:47:12,312 --> 00:47:14,393
Speaker 1: Under shot, it's a good category.

407
00:47:14,773 --> 00:47:15,634
Speaker 1: It's a fiber shot.

408
00:47:15,674 --> 00:47:15,954
Speaker 1: Yes, but wood.

409
00:47:21,716 --> 00:47:25,159
Speaker 0: So it's suggest based on weave?

410
00:47:27,541 --> 00:47:43,794
Speaker 0: I haven't tried it yet but I think there there's a. yeah I could implement it in the man pot to have it suggest based on weave?

411
00:47:47,665 --> 00:47:51,010
Speaker 0: So would that suggest weaved materials?

412
00:47:51,511 --> 00:47:52,953
Speaker 1: What are the types of weaved materials?

413
00:47:56,918 --> 00:48:03,421
Speaker 1: Ah, for example, furniture, textures, etc.

414
00:48:03,641 --> 00:48:05,562
Speaker 1: works in Kanatka one way.

415
00:48:05,702 --> 00:48:07,503
Speaker 1: Wicker type.

416
00:48:07,823 --> 00:48:08,704
Speaker 1: Paramo, weaker.

417
00:48:09,304 --> 00:48:10,444
Speaker 1: Ah, weaker.

418
00:48:10,685 --> 00:48:12,586
Speaker 1: Okay, I think it's based on style.

419
00:48:12,646 --> 00:48:14,807
Speaker 0: But okay, so it's just based on weave.

420
00:48:24,256 --> 00:48:32,041
Speaker 0: Apart from that, my second question is, this suggests materials based on style only.

421
00:48:32,421 --> 00:48:37,004
Speaker 0: So what are you hoping to search materials based on?

422
00:48:38,882 --> 00:48:41,605
Speaker 1: I have a question.

423
00:48:44,148 --> 00:48:49,453
Speaker 1: What if I prefer to create my own interior design style?

424
00:48:49,473 --> 00:49:03,645
Speaker 1: For example, I'm designing a store, for example, for bench, and then I set a standard material and standard for that specific project.

425
00:49:03,925 --> 00:49:16,027
Speaker 1: Can I also... If I have a feature for the app for the user, I can create my own template.

426
00:49:18,167 --> 00:49:29,672
Speaker 1: So, for example, if I have a Sanex project, for example, a store, under that project branding.

427
00:49:38,476 --> 00:49:44,597
Speaker 0: Okay, so there is no template for my Naka Setna style.

428
00:49:44,617 --> 00:49:48,158
Speaker 0: That was my Naka Setna materials.

429
00:49:48,618 --> 00:49:53,279
Speaker 1: I think that could also be helpful.

430
00:49:53,299 --> 00:49:59,901
Speaker 1: I would like to see if there is a project or a render or something like that.

431
00:50:00,041 --> 00:50:04,402
Speaker 1: At least there is no project with that type of material under that template.

432
00:50:04,482 --> 00:50:11,849
Speaker 1: Like for example, I would make my own modern interior design theme.

433
00:50:11,909 --> 00:50:14,331
Speaker 1: This is the definition of modern.

434
00:50:15,993 --> 00:50:18,675
Speaker 1: This is how it is arranged, how it is adjusted.

435
00:50:30,410 --> 00:50:42,648
Speaker 1: Would that also be a tool for the user to have freedom to make his or her own material template or design template?

436
00:50:44,412 --> 00:50:45,052
Speaker 0: Okay.

437
00:50:45,493 --> 00:50:55,277
Speaker 0: So, were you expecting now like, if you look at the bottom right, or bottom here, save as template.

438
00:50:56,978 --> 00:50:58,659
Speaker 0: Yeah, something like that.

439
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:05,162
Speaker 1: For example, you know, and then we're going to adjust the material.

440
00:51:05,362 --> 00:51:10,325
Speaker 1: And then the next time that I would work on this type of project, we start the same style in London.

441
00:51:12,352 --> 00:51:19,083
Speaker 1: But I'm much better if, but I'm not in a just mode, but I'm into it.

442
00:51:23,274 --> 00:51:26,176
Speaker 1: but there are many categories.

443
00:51:26,316 --> 00:51:31,459
Speaker 1: There are many other types of projects, but there are many categories.

444
00:51:32,379 --> 00:51:40,864
Speaker 1: There are a lot of materials from previous projects, but there are a lot of materials that have been rendered.

445
00:51:40,964 --> 00:51:46,026
Speaker 0: Okay, so there are many kinds of materials of that style, I see.

446
00:51:46,047 --> 00:51:49,749
Speaker 1: Yes, but there are many different types of materials.

447
00:51:51,184 --> 00:51:52,145
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.

448
00:51:52,205 --> 00:51:54,347
Speaker 1: But I didn't learn any limits.

449
00:51:55,247 --> 00:51:57,869
Speaker 1: But I didn't learn any limits category.

450
00:51:58,990 --> 00:52:01,592
Speaker 1: No, no, neither.

451
00:52:01,913 --> 00:52:06,897
Speaker 1: But I'm going to guess it the body to Ilan longshan model contemporary.

452
00:52:07,817 --> 00:52:14,282
Speaker 1: But how much better if my option did a pattern ad style, but I'm gonna put emotion in the style.

453
00:52:15,323 --> 00:52:23,108
Speaker 1: And my freedom belonging user has created my own style now.

454
00:52:23,388 --> 00:52:28,671
Speaker 1: From my end, when I started my project, I had a store interior.

455
00:52:28,691 --> 00:52:35,735
Speaker 1: And now, I'm working on a project now.

456
00:52:35,755 --> 00:52:38,016
Speaker 1: I'm going to consider it as a template.

457
00:52:38,036 --> 00:52:38,196
Speaker 1: Okay.

458
00:52:43,659 --> 00:52:52,968
Speaker 1: But I understand since it's a generic style base, it's more like a GPP, AI.

459
00:52:55,290 --> 00:52:56,952
Speaker 0: So for yours, it's more on like...

460
00:52:57,753 --> 00:52:59,554
Speaker 1: Personalization.

461
00:52:59,734 --> 00:53:00,115
Speaker 0: Yeah.

462
00:53:00,395 --> 00:53:12,766
Speaker 0: So when you select the material, Let's say for these materials here, let's say we finalize the material in the project, we save the template, and let's say we do a meeting.

463
00:53:13,266 --> 00:53:16,129
Speaker 0: Not just materials, but also color palettes.

464
00:53:16,429 --> 00:53:21,414
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I'm gonna... Parashang, Parang is saying interface with Lightroom.

465
00:53:21,554 --> 00:53:22,875
Speaker 1: Have you tried using it?

466
00:53:23,848 --> 00:53:24,689
Speaker 0: Adobe Lightroom?

467
00:53:25,249 --> 00:53:32,033
Speaker 1: Yes, you can adjust the image, right?

468
00:53:32,093 --> 00:53:38,117
Speaker 1: And then you can control the settings and then you can just copy paste it to the next image.

469
00:53:41,579 --> 00:53:43,920
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.

470
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:51,905
Speaker 1: You can adjust the Lightroom by using a filter known as a DNG type of file.

471
00:53:53,386 --> 00:53:55,147
Speaker 1: Yes, for example, do you get...

472
00:53:55,167 --> 00:54:00,071
Speaker 0: Yes, for example, you can contrast my values, that's another value, you can save it.

473
00:54:00,091 --> 00:54:05,555
Speaker 1: Yes, for example, filters in a rendering setting, for example.

474
00:54:05,795 --> 00:54:08,036
Speaker 1: There is a name template for that.

475
00:54:08,137 --> 00:54:12,920
Speaker 1: For the next project, we have a store interior motif.

476
00:54:13,340 --> 00:54:35,596
Speaker 0: So when you're suggesting materials or creating materials hoping that you could like save Yeah, I've already mentioned the past materials before.

477
00:54:35,616 --> 00:54:37,097
Speaker 0: Okay, all right.

478
00:54:37,557 --> 00:54:38,117
Speaker 0: Okay, got it.

479
00:54:39,278 --> 00:54:53,582
Speaker 0: Okay, were you hoping to suggest it, like, would it help, because this is an idea, but it's not executed, would it help if you suggest materials based on the design requirements?

480
00:54:54,922 --> 00:55:08,706
Speaker 0: Like for, you said design requirements, correct me if I'm wrong, but like the client is looking for let's say a low cost or mid-range residential space.

481
00:55:09,226 --> 00:55:10,026
Speaker 0: so would it help?

482
00:55:10,086 --> 00:55:15,647
Speaker 0: now it would like suggest materials based on like the what do I call like cost?

483
00:55:15,707 --> 00:55:22,328
Speaker 1: like there's high end mid-range like for example if you're targeting low cost.

484
00:55:22,348 --> 00:55:38,875
Speaker 1: I think I think that would be helpful for at least a new user, because at least they can see the limits of the material within that budget.

485
00:55:43,798 --> 00:55:46,362
Speaker 1: I don't know how much time it takes to get to the beginning.

486
00:55:47,023 --> 00:55:48,265
Speaker 1: I don't know.

487
00:55:48,385 --> 00:55:52,551
Speaker 1: I don't know how much time it takes to get to the beginning.

488
00:55:52,591 --> 00:55:53,833
Speaker 1: That would be a nice thing.

489
00:56:00,181 --> 00:56:03,002
Speaker 0: So before we move, oh wait, sorry, we have only seven minutes.

490
00:56:03,803 --> 00:56:06,964
Speaker 0: Is it possible to extend or do you have a meeting after this?

491
00:56:07,524 --> 00:56:12,646
Speaker 1: I can extend a bit, if you need my feedback.

492
00:56:12,706 --> 00:56:14,127
Speaker 1: I'm not sure if I can extend my feedback.

493
00:56:15,379 --> 00:56:17,900
Speaker 0: So that's for the suggestion of materials.

494
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:24,103
Speaker 1: Are there any other ways you hope the prototype to suggest by apart from let's say suggest by style or suggest by cost?

495
00:56:24,163 --> 00:56:51,897
Speaker 0: or Would it help if, like, let's say, I suggest based on the object, like, what are materials used for a floor?

496
00:56:51,917 --> 00:56:55,198
Speaker 1: That can also be an okay feature.

497
00:56:55,238 --> 00:56:56,698
Speaker 1: For example, the floor.

498
00:56:58,538 --> 00:57:02,579
Speaker 1: For example, I can use this material.

499
00:57:09,841 --> 00:57:11,383
Speaker 1: For example, for example it's a phone.

500
00:57:28,163 --> 00:57:36,012
Speaker 1: I think usually it's applicable to metal, but I don't think it's a good feature, because you can use it on glass or on a cloth.

501
00:57:43,447 --> 00:57:50,116
Speaker 1: I think that would be much better, but at least for additional knowledge to use a user.

502
00:57:50,637 --> 00:57:54,121
Speaker 1: For example, if you have a professional student, you can do something like that.

503
00:57:58,727 --> 00:58:05,892
Speaker 0: okay okay um going back to suggestion on color spot.

504
00:58:05,972 --> 00:58:17,701
Speaker 0: and so yeah my last question is because so far it adds the color finish individually like you have to select one thousand but it must apply to the object one at a time.

505
00:58:18,041 --> 00:58:30,090
Speaker 0: would it help if you like Distribute the colors to the entire scene or something like that but in a click of a button, but they distribute by

506
00:58:32,712 --> 00:58:35,354
Speaker 1: your colors Let's

507
00:58:35,374 --> 00:58:50,766
Speaker 0: say for Let's say if I see this color pad for instance tapos when I compare it to in the paleo Would it help if I, with this color palette, it automatically colors the entire room?

508
00:58:51,746 --> 00:58:52,567
Speaker 0: Like with these colors?

509
00:58:52,587 --> 00:58:57,810
Speaker 1: Like for example, I'm applying just a wall and ceiling, just on the flooring.

510
00:58:58,731 --> 00:59:02,333
Speaker 0: Like it equally distributes the colors, would it help?

511
00:59:04,574 --> 00:59:09,616
Speaker 0: So that way you don't need to continuously point and click on different parts.

512
00:59:09,636 --> 00:59:11,636
Speaker 0: Do you get what I'm saying?

513
00:59:11,656 --> 00:59:15,577
Speaker 1: For example, I clicked on the color green.

514
00:59:17,698 --> 00:59:19,518
Speaker 1: No, no, like with this entire color palette.

515
00:59:19,538 --> 00:59:21,759
Speaker 1: Let's say there's a button called apply to entire rendering.

516
00:59:30,603 --> 00:59:34,565
Speaker 0: So the college I applied, yes.

517
00:59:36,025 --> 00:59:37,986
Speaker 0: Where would it top down, Ganyan?

518
00:59:38,006 --> 00:59:50,252
Speaker 1: I think it's also a nice feature, but I would like to put it into a box option.

519
00:59:50,512 --> 00:59:53,393
Speaker 0: Would it like induce fixation, Ganyanpo?

520
00:59:59,723 --> 01:00:02,485
Speaker 1: You can do that, not just the ordering.

521
01:00:02,865 --> 01:00:07,308
Speaker 1: For example, you'll be choosing this code or based on the colour.

522
01:00:28,523 --> 01:00:30,986
Speaker 1: Yes, yes.

523
01:00:52,774 --> 01:00:58,835
Speaker 0: Yes, like the button that assigns it.

524
01:01:00,476 --> 01:01:04,536
Speaker 0: At the same time, it's very harmonious in the room.

525
01:01:04,836 --> 01:01:05,817
Speaker 1: I think it's okay.

526
01:01:06,697 --> 01:01:08,397
Speaker 1: In terms of color, I think it's okay.

527
01:01:08,417 --> 01:01:08,657
Speaker 1: It's okay.

528
01:01:08,697 --> 01:01:09,257
Speaker 1: I think it's okay.

529
01:01:09,277 --> 01:01:11,178
Speaker 1: I think it's okay.

530
01:01:11,218 --> 01:01:12,018
Speaker 1: I think it's okay.

531
01:01:12,038 --> 01:01:13,138
Speaker 1: I think it's okay.

532
01:01:13,198 --> 01:01:13,998
Speaker 1: I think it's okay.

533
01:01:14,018 --> 01:01:14,578
Speaker 1: I think it's okay.

534
01:01:14,639 --> 01:01:15,739
Speaker 1: I think it's okay.

535
01:01:15,859 --> 01:01:17,359
Speaker 1: I think it's okay.

536
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:25,441
Speaker 1: I don't know if it's a color palette.

537
01:01:25,941 --> 01:01:28,022
Speaker 0: Like, my refresh button or something?

538
01:01:28,202 --> 01:01:29,683
Speaker 0: Or like, if you select this.

539
01:01:29,783 --> 01:01:30,603
Speaker 1: Or customize.

540
01:01:31,343 --> 01:01:32,084
Speaker 1: Something like that.

541
01:01:33,024 --> 01:01:36,765
Speaker 1: Aside from suggest, customize your own 2G.

542
01:01:37,045 --> 01:01:38,866
Speaker 0: Like, when you add a new color palette.

543
01:01:39,126 --> 01:01:46,709
Speaker 0: Like, let's say in the empty, we can customize the color palette.

544
01:01:47,689 --> 01:01:48,669
Speaker 0: Like, something like that.

545
01:01:48,709 --> 01:01:49,910
Speaker 1: Yeah, something like that.

546
01:01:50,396 --> 01:01:53,679
Speaker 0: Okay, so this is my additional new palette.

547
01:01:54,359 --> 01:01:57,722
Speaker 0: Okay, all right, understood.

548
01:01:59,984 --> 01:02:02,987
Speaker 0: So that's the suggest materials and suggest colors.

549
01:02:03,507 --> 01:02:08,051
Speaker 0: So lastly, if you look at the right side, the second tab, it shows feedback.

550
01:02:08,812 --> 01:02:16,038
Speaker 0: Currently, the material, this prototype.

551
01:02:16,138 --> 01:02:20,962
Speaker 0: it gives feedback based on the assembly parts together.

552
01:02:21,762 --> 01:02:25,685
Speaker 0: so for different objects let's say for bed.

553
01:02:26,826 --> 01:02:32,250
Speaker 0: so if you look at this let me know if like more confusing you know.

554
01:02:33,891 --> 01:02:39,815
Speaker 0: But what this means is that the headboard is attached to the bed frame.

555
01:02:41,416 --> 01:02:43,397
Speaker 0: And it shows the different materials.

556
01:02:44,018 --> 01:02:53,263
Speaker 0: So the purpose of this is to suggest different ways to attach parts of different materials together.

557
01:02:53,283 --> 01:03:01,729
Speaker 0: If I want to find ways to suggest to attach the headboard to the bed frame.

558
01:03:03,948 --> 01:03:12,440
Speaker 0: and when you suggest it for installation yes that was my suggestions on how you can do it.

559
01:03:22,793 --> 01:03:34,681
Speaker 0: But yes, and you can do the same for side tables, of course Nipushya applicable for all parts, because I put in floor for example, but young shelves for example.

560
01:03:35,541 --> 01:03:38,663
Speaker 0: Did you notice the first time he shelves?

561
01:03:38,964 --> 01:03:40,605
Speaker 0: It's horizontal.

562
01:03:40,625 --> 01:03:40,905
Speaker 0: Ledge?

563
01:03:41,426 --> 01:03:42,727
Speaker 0: I don't know the right terms for a shelf.

564
01:03:58,138 --> 01:03:58,899
Speaker 0: it's all kind.

565
01:03:58,959 --> 01:04:00,780
Speaker 0: it's made of steel.

566
01:04:01,381 --> 01:04:04,764
Speaker 0: if you look at the shelf here that was so.

567
01:04:05,004 --> 01:04:20,245
Speaker 0: you can suggest the attachments here and when you suggest it I'm okay with that.

568
01:04:20,265 --> 01:04:22,046
Speaker 1: There is additional input in here.

569
01:04:22,066 --> 01:04:25,508
Speaker 1: There are a lot of designers who are knowledgeable on how to install.

570
01:04:25,528 --> 01:04:30,372
Speaker 1: There is also a lot of construction.

571
01:04:30,912 --> 01:04:36,075
Speaker 1: But even in the appearance, you can see the viewport.

572
01:04:37,536 --> 01:04:39,277
Speaker 1: There are a lot of things for me.

573
01:04:40,218 --> 01:04:41,879
Speaker 1: I don't know if it's the row.

574
01:04:42,759 --> 01:04:43,439
Speaker 1: Before and after the game.

575
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:45,120
Speaker 1: Before and after the game.

576
01:04:45,140 --> 01:04:46,621
Speaker 1: Before and after the game.

577
01:04:46,641 --> 01:04:47,482
Speaker 0: Before and after the game.

578
01:04:47,522 --> 01:04:49,323
Speaker 0: Before and after the game.

579
01:04:49,343 --> 01:04:51,224
Speaker 1: Before and after the game.

580
01:04:51,324 --> 01:04:53,345
Speaker 1: Before and after the game.

581
01:04:53,365 --> 01:04:54,926
Speaker 1: Before and after the game.

582
01:04:54,946 --> 01:04:56,767
Speaker 1: Before and after the game.

583
01:04:56,787 --> 01:04:58,348
Speaker 1: Before and after the game.

584
01:04:58,388 --> 01:04:59,529
Speaker 1: Before and after the game.

585
01:05:00,249 --> 01:05:01,150
Speaker 1: Before and after the game.

586
01:05:10,410 --> 01:05:18,400
Speaker 1: But aside from that, I'd like to suggest on how to install things.

587
01:05:18,861 --> 01:05:19,922
Speaker 1: But I think it's a good feature.

588
01:05:26,232 --> 01:05:27,673
Speaker 0: Okay, understood.

589
01:05:29,475 --> 01:05:41,565
Speaker 0: So apart from that, currently it gives feedback on how the parts are assembled together based on the materials used.

590
01:05:41,866 --> 01:05:48,011
Speaker 0: So my question is, what are other things you hope the system could give feedback on?

591
01:05:51,147 --> 01:05:56,193
Speaker 1: Aside from that, I think an additional feature like Seguro.

592
01:06:05,726 --> 01:06:06,526
Speaker 1: I don't know if it's possible.

593
01:06:06,546 --> 01:06:07,647
Speaker 1: I don't know about standard sizing.

594
01:06:07,727 --> 01:06:08,367
Speaker 1: Would that also be possible?

595
01:06:08,387 --> 01:06:09,187
Speaker 1: Like it's a shelf ledge.

596
01:06:09,207 --> 01:06:09,847
Speaker 1: I don't know if it's possible.

597
01:06:09,867 --> 01:06:10,568
Speaker 1: I don't know about standard sizing.

598
01:06:10,588 --> 01:06:11,248
Speaker 1: Would that also be possible?

599
01:06:11,268 --> 01:06:11,728
Speaker 1: Like it's a shelf ledge.

600
01:06:11,768 --> 01:06:12,448
Speaker 1: I don't know about standard sizing.

601
01:06:12,468 --> 01:06:13,268
Speaker 1: Would that also be possible?

602
01:06:13,288 --> 01:06:13,989
Speaker 1: Like it's a shelf ledge.

603
01:06:14,009 --> 01:06:14,709
Speaker 1: I don't know about standard sizing.

604
01:06:14,729 --> 01:06:15,329
Speaker 1: Would that also be possible?

605
01:06:15,349 --> 01:06:15,829
Speaker 1: Like it's a shelf ledge.

606
01:06:15,849 --> 01:06:16,629
Speaker 1: I don't know about standard sizing.

607
01:06:16,649 --> 01:06:17,490
Speaker 1: Would that also be possible?

608
01:06:17,510 --> 01:06:17,970
Speaker 1: Like it's a shelf ledge.

609
01:06:17,990 --> 01:06:19,170
Speaker 1: I don't know about standard sizing.

610
01:06:19,190 --> 01:06:19,810
Speaker 1: Would that also be possible?

611
01:06:19,830 --> 01:06:20,291
Speaker 1: Like it's a shelf ledge.

612
01:06:20,311 --> 01:06:21,251
Speaker 1: I don't know about standard sizing.

613
01:06:21,271 --> 01:06:21,831
Speaker 1: Would that also be possible?

614
01:06:21,851 --> 01:06:22,411
Speaker 1: Like it's a shelf ledge.

615
01:06:22,431 --> 01:06:23,172
Speaker 1: I don't know about standard sizing.

616
01:06:23,212 --> 01:06:23,832
Speaker 1: Would that also be possible?

617
01:06:23,852 --> 01:06:24,312
Speaker 1: Like it's a shelf ledge.

618
01:06:24,332 --> 01:06:24,972
Speaker 1: Would that also be possible?

619
01:06:24,992 --> 01:06:25,452
Speaker 1: Like it's a shelf ledge.

620
01:06:25,472 --> 01:06:26,052
Speaker 1: Would that also be possible?

621
01:06:26,072 --> 01:06:26,553
Speaker 1: Like it's a shelf ledge?

622
01:06:26,573 --> 01:06:27,153
Speaker 1: Would that also be possible?

623
01:06:27,173 --> 01:06:33,895
Speaker 1: Like it's a shelf ledge if the display of the box is 0.13 meters, I guess.

624
01:06:34,815 --> 01:06:40,676
Speaker 1: It would be much better if the box is more than 100 meters when it comes to standard sizing.

625
01:06:41,476 --> 01:06:46,818
Speaker 0: So, feedback on proportion, sizing of the objects.

626
01:06:47,498 --> 01:06:47,738
Speaker 1: Yeah.

627
01:06:48,590 --> 01:06:50,991
Speaker 0: Okay, so measurements.

628
01:06:51,011 --> 01:06:52,572
Speaker 1: That's important.

629
01:07:09,611 --> 01:07:10,312
Speaker 1: Yeah.

630
01:07:10,752 --> 01:07:12,553
Speaker 1: Most especially is interior design.

631
01:07:12,873 --> 01:07:16,276
Speaker 1: I'm sure it's even more important in sizing.

632
01:07:16,656 --> 01:07:17,917
Speaker 0: Even furniture design.

633
01:07:18,137 --> 01:07:18,477
Speaker 0: Yeah.

634
01:07:19,338 --> 01:07:24,321
Speaker 1: Standard seat height, standard door height or something like that.

635
01:07:25,262 --> 01:07:25,502
Speaker 0: Okay.

636
01:07:26,743 --> 01:07:27,363
Speaker 0: Okay, understood.

637
01:07:28,684 --> 01:07:30,466
Speaker 0: I think we only have five minutes.

638
01:07:30,886 --> 01:07:41,994
Speaker 0: So apart from that, before I... Before I lend to you the prototype to try it out, what other ways do you hope this prototype could give feedback on?

639
01:07:43,655 --> 01:07:48,298
Speaker 1: In what sense?

640
01:07:49,359 --> 01:07:55,423
Speaker 0: Well, it could be about the room regarding proportions, but is there any feedback on the materials?

641
01:07:56,504 --> 01:08:01,828
Speaker 0: It could give feedback on some materials.

642
01:08:04,515 --> 01:08:07,016
Speaker 1: I think that would be helpful.

643
01:08:07,096 --> 01:08:10,737
Speaker 1: For example, in the coastal area, that would be helpful.

644
01:08:10,757 --> 01:08:14,177
Speaker 1: For example, in the coastal area, that would be helpful.

645
01:08:15,478 --> 01:08:22,059
Speaker 1: For example, in the coastal area, that would be helpful.

646
01:08:30,041 --> 01:08:43,865
Speaker 1: or in a tropical environment setting, it is a material that can be worked out, but it can be used in metals, in metals, in tropical settings, in absorption and heat.

647
01:08:44,886 --> 01:08:45,207
Speaker 0: Okay.

648
01:08:45,647 --> 01:08:45,867
Speaker 0: Okay.

649
01:08:45,908 --> 01:08:46,608
Speaker 0: Understood.

650
01:08:47,548 --> 01:08:47,868
Speaker 0: All right.

651
01:08:47,988 --> 01:08:48,228
Speaker 0: Okay.

652
01:08:48,268 --> 01:08:48,649
Speaker 0: Noted.

653
01:08:49,589 --> 01:08:49,868
Speaker 0: Okay.

654
01:08:50,870 --> 01:08:54,970
Speaker 0: So is there anything else you have comments to say before?

655
01:08:54,991 --> 01:09:00,974
Speaker 0: I let you try the prototype itself?

656
01:09:01,453 --> 01:09:02,174
Speaker 1: I'll let you know.

657
01:09:02,434 --> 01:09:14,939
Speaker 1: But at the moment, I think, you know, Would you like to try it out?

658
01:09:15,220 --> 01:09:18,421
Speaker 0: Sure, how can I try this out?

659
01:09:18,622 --> 01:09:27,548
Speaker 0: So if you see on your screen and you're on the top part on the zoom it says you're viewing RG Gallega's screen.

660
01:09:28,388 --> 01:09:28,608
Speaker 0: Yeah.

661
01:09:28,627 --> 01:09:30,970
Speaker 0: So on the right, my view options.

662
01:09:31,290 --> 01:09:33,072
Speaker 0: Ah, request remote control.

663
01:09:33,112 --> 01:09:34,653
Speaker 0: Yes, request remote control.

664
01:09:35,212 --> 01:09:42,358
Speaker 0: So that allows you to control my mouse and you can actually type onto the yes button.

665
01:09:42,959 --> 01:09:47,742
Speaker 0: If you click on the screen, if you click on the screen, do you see it?

666
01:09:48,462 --> 01:09:50,644
Speaker 0: Ah, I see.

667
01:09:50,865 --> 01:09:52,725
Speaker 0: But you can also control it by yourself.

668
01:09:53,707 --> 01:09:56,509
Speaker 0: So you can play around with it for the remaining time.

669
01:09:58,059 --> 01:09:58,820
Speaker 1: Let me try.

670
01:09:58,840 --> 01:10:04,405
Speaker 1: If you want to enable remote access, you can enable remote access.

671
01:10:22,978 --> 01:10:29,142
Speaker 0: I don't know how to use it, but you can use it as an option when you're sharing your screen.

672
01:10:31,984 --> 01:10:34,586
Speaker 0: Was that something you're expecting for metal?

673
01:10:35,867 --> 01:10:39,609
Speaker 1: Actually, not actually, but more like leather.

674
01:10:40,410 --> 01:10:40,670
Speaker 0: Okay.

675
01:10:43,492 --> 01:10:47,895
Speaker 0: You could also refresh it until you... Sorry, wait, sorry.

676
01:10:47,935 --> 01:10:50,157
Speaker 0: You'll probably push it if you apply it.

677
01:10:50,457 --> 01:10:50,597
Speaker 0: Yeah.

678
01:10:59,953 --> 01:11:08,581
Speaker 0: generate sorry you have to go to the previous page if you scroll down but on my my previous button book if you go to rev.

679
01:11:09,061 --> 01:11:10,362
Speaker 0: but yeah um yeah okay noted.

680
01:11:25,187 --> 01:11:27,153
Speaker 1: So, this is the sample material.

681
01:11:35,279 --> 01:11:41,540
Speaker 0: If you say metal, were you expecting a shiny brushed metal?

682
01:11:41,780 --> 01:11:44,001
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was what I was expecting.

683
01:11:44,561 --> 01:11:45,001
Speaker 0: Okay.

684
01:11:46,401 --> 01:11:49,222
Speaker 1: Maybe you could try brushed metal?

685
01:11:49,262 --> 01:11:49,822
Speaker 1: I think so.

686
01:12:15,262 --> 01:12:22,007
Speaker 0: If you're aware both like, you know, is upon AI now the trend, the one that's doing the AI generated art.

687
01:12:25,029 --> 01:12:34,416
Speaker 0: So you like, like on social media, there's okay, so there's an issue there.

688
01:12:34,657 --> 01:12:34,897
Speaker 1: Yes.

689
01:12:36,089 --> 01:12:37,869
Speaker 1: But anyway, I'll just try collecting this.

690
01:12:37,929 --> 01:12:39,370
Speaker 1: And then next.

691
01:12:39,390 --> 01:12:39,510
Speaker 1: Yes.

692
01:12:39,530 --> 01:12:40,810
Speaker 1: I should import some application.

693
01:12:40,830 --> 01:12:40,930
Speaker 1: Yes.

694
01:12:57,795 --> 01:13:01,017
Speaker 0: Yes, it applies to the floor.

695
01:13:01,417 --> 01:13:08,701
Speaker 0: But take note, the ones that were selected, but they were previously selected before, they were not selected yet.

696
01:13:09,082 --> 01:13:11,303
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.

697
01:13:11,343 --> 01:13:12,864
Speaker 1: So we have to select them.

698
01:13:12,984 --> 01:13:14,225
Speaker 1: We have to check them.

699
01:13:14,305 --> 01:13:15,405
Speaker 0: Okay, I guess.

700
01:13:15,866 --> 01:13:16,426
Speaker 0: Sorry, okay.

701
01:13:17,807 --> 01:13:18,207
Speaker 1: Okay.

702
01:13:19,168 --> 01:13:22,790
Speaker 1: So if you want to select, then apply texture, right?

703
01:13:23,270 --> 01:13:24,271
Speaker 1: And then refresh.

704
01:13:25,529 --> 01:13:37,395
Speaker 1: yes oh wait ah wait tamaba I should click on the next one.

705
01:13:37,415 --> 01:13:37,956
Speaker 1: Okay, so it's undoed.

706
01:13:37,976 --> 01:13:39,696
Speaker 1: And then, I should click on the next one.

707
01:13:39,736 --> 01:13:40,456
Speaker 1: I should click on the next one.

708
01:13:40,516 --> 01:13:41,957
Speaker 0: I should click on the next one.

709
01:14:01,809 --> 01:14:02,710
Speaker 1: Apply to current render.

710
01:14:02,730 --> 01:14:03,410
Speaker 1: Do you want to apply finish?

711
01:14:03,430 --> 01:14:04,511
Speaker 1: Yes, apply finish to current rendering.

712
01:14:04,531 --> 01:14:05,351

Speaker 1: Yes, apply finish.

738
01:14:35,572 --> 01:14:37,513
Speaker 1: I would know how long will I wait.

739
01:15:04,643 --> 01:15:14,872
Speaker 1: But it doesn't have an official application name, but I tentatively named it func and form.

740
01:15:26,251 --> 01:15:29,532
Speaker 0: Function and form.

741
01:15:31,912 --> 01:15:39,415
Speaker 0: It's supposed to facilitate like you look at the same time functionality but in a sense functionality.

742
01:15:39,475 --> 01:15:53,480
Speaker 0: right now it could be like assembled together but oh yeah I'll consider the other things you mentioned but like regarding the sizing and the durability to make sure it's more functional.

743
01:15:53,700 --> 01:15:58,418
Speaker 0: the design Sorry, wait.

744
01:15:59,079 --> 01:16:02,701
Speaker 0: I'm just going to check if it's in the shower.

745
01:16:02,721 --> 01:16:05,583
Speaker 0: Or in my shower.

746
01:16:05,964 --> 01:16:07,605
Speaker 0: I think it's really slow.

747
01:16:09,426 --> 01:16:09,947
Speaker 0: Sorry, wait.

748
01:16:10,007 --> 01:16:11,268
Speaker 0: Okay, I think it's updated.

749
01:16:11,348 --> 01:16:11,588
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

750
01:16:11,608 --> 01:16:12,008
Speaker 0: I think it's done.

751
01:16:12,068 --> 01:16:12,348
Speaker 0: It's done.

752
01:16:12,368 --> 01:16:13,609
Speaker 0: I think it's done.

753
01:16:15,050 --> 01:16:15,731
Speaker 1: I think it's done.

754
01:16:15,851 --> 01:16:16,091
Speaker 1: It's done.

755
01:16:16,151 --> 01:16:16,892
Speaker 1: I think it's done.

756
01:16:16,912 --> 01:16:18,533
Speaker 0: So, you can try it again if you want, yeah.

757
01:16:34,147 --> 01:16:40,052
Speaker 0: The goal of this is so that you could use it during the session with your clients.

758
01:16:40,692 --> 01:16:42,674
Speaker 0: So let's say your clients didn't want to change materials.

759
01:16:43,415 --> 01:16:48,019
Speaker 0: So that's the purpose of this prototype.

760
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:51,963
Speaker 0: It's to show the final product but you could like make changes on the spot.

761
01:16:52,563 --> 01:16:54,605
Speaker 1: Overall, what do you think is beneficial about this prototype?

762
01:16:54,625 --> 01:16:56,227
Speaker 0: What are other suggestions?

763
01:16:56,247 --> 01:17:12,772
Speaker 1: Apart from the ones you mentioned before, I think there are a lot of things.

764
01:17:12,892 --> 01:17:19,717
Speaker 1: There are a lot of visually engaging features.

765
01:17:19,757 --> 01:17:21,158
Speaker 1: There is also an interface.

766
01:17:21,178 --> 01:17:36,467
Speaker 1: For me, there are very... I'm not sure if it's very institutional or if it's better if my way to make the interface more engaging.

767
01:17:36,847 --> 01:17:44,149
Speaker 1: Although I think it's more of a simplicity point and point and point, but I think it's more of a maintenance.

768
01:17:44,649 --> 01:17:52,231
Speaker 1: But aside from the things that I mentioned, other than that, I think this app is very helpful.

769
01:17:55,780 --> 01:17:57,441
Speaker 1: But if ever then.

770
01:17:57,461 --> 01:17:58,141
Speaker 1: Next time.

771
01:17:58,181 --> 01:17:59,061
Speaker 1: Real time rendering.

772
01:18:10,605 --> 01:18:12,006
Speaker 1: Basically, it's more engaging.

773
01:18:12,126 --> 01:18:14,248
Speaker 1: So, that concludes the session.

774
01:18:14,308 --> 01:18:16,670
Speaker 0: So, thank you for having your time again.

775
01:18:17,170 --> 01:18:19,532
Speaker 0: And may I come to you again for follow-up sessions?

776
01:18:19,552 --> 01:18:21,274
Speaker 1: Sure, just let me know in advance.

777
01:18:40,376 --> 01:18:42,099
Speaker 1: Thank you for reminding me.

778
01:18:42,199 --> 01:18:43,302
Speaker 1: Honestly, I forgot.

779
01:18:43,342 --> 01:18:45,866
Speaker 1: Thank you, R.G I'll end this meeting.

780
01:18:46,007 --> 01:18:46,307
Speaker 0: Bye.
